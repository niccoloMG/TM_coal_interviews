## Abstract
The political economy is pivotal to understand ongoing investments in coal-fired power plants. Here, we conduct a computational analysis of 212 interviews from 12 countries on the political economy of coal using topic modelling (TM). We highlight relevant topics by actor group and country. Most topics are similarly distributed across all actor groups. With regards to countries, we find distinct clusters in which similar topics play important roles. For example, in Indonesia and India, sustaining low electricity tariffs is brought forward as a reason to invest in coal, and in South Africa and Kenya the civil society is considered instrumental in the choice of coal or alternatives. We compare our results to outcomes of qualitative case studies and to papers grouping countries based on quantifiable factors. As this study is among the first to apply TM to interview data, we thereby highlight strengths and challenges for such applications and the interpretability of results.
